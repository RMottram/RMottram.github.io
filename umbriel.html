        <p class="portfolio-text">Umbriel is a self made iOS application that can be used for several different purposes. One purpose is to simply test the strength of a password before you use it to secure your account for Facebook, email or work account for example. Another purpose is that if you cannot think of a strong password, Umbriel can create one for you along with the ability to customise it to make it as complex as you wish by adding numbers and symbols if you wish (which is highly recommended anyway!). The last purpose is to store your passwords you use for your many accounts in a safe and secure section of the app which is locked behind your devices TouchID or FaceID sensors*. Other additional security comes with your own devices hardware and the iOS version you are running.

        <h3 class="subtitles" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
            The app crashes on me, what do I do?
        </h3>
        <p class="portfolio-text" style="text-align: left;">
            Umbriel works for iPhone models between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 11 Pro and iPad models 2014 or newer.
            Umbriel needs to be on a device that runs iOS 13 or higher. Intermittent crashes can be regular on most applications, if the issue keeps occurring, 
            un-install and re-install Umbriel and try it then. Any further issues after this please contact us to discuss the issues further and in detail.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitles" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
            Are there any other features?
        </h3>
        <p class="portfolio-text" style="text-align: left;">
            Umbriel is currently at version 1.4 which is the version where the full functionality of the app has been implemented however features can be suggested by using the feedback system within the app.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitles" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
            Why did you create this?
        </h3>
        <p class="portfolio-text" style="text-align: left;">
            This app was a smaller feature in another app I created for my level 3 project at University. I chose to make it as a standalone app because it 
            got the most appraisal, I already had plans on how I could make it its own app and it was something to do during the summer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitles" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
            Is any of my information stored, recorded or shared?
        </h3>
        <p class="portfolio-text" style="text-align: left;">
            No. Umbriel does not request any form of your information in order for you to use its functionality.
            Any passwords you try in the app none of the entries are recorded and stored, it is simply used as a reference for the algorithms to calculate
            the strength. I have also not incorporated any social features or ads so there is no way services like Google or Facebook can retrieve your data. Your password entries are stored within your own device with no external database used to store and push your entries to your devices. Umbriel uses iCloud so that your entries can sync across any other devices you have Umbriel installed on.
